# Nasal-Sensor-module
A thermistor based nasal sensor


This is a tool allowing continuous accurate measurement and recording of airflow in each nostril separately.Exploring the nasal cycle unveils a connection with vital physiological measuresâ€”heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, glucose levels, intraocular pressure, blink rate, metabolic rate, and oxygen consumption. Serving as an intricate indicator of autonomic arousal and offering insights into brain function asymmetry, the nasal cycle becomes a captivating avenue for monitoring internal body cycles and potential markers for diseases.I implemented a system utilizing a thermistor interfaced with an Atmega microcontroller to capture real-time breathing signals. These signals were then transmitted to a mobile application for immediate monitoring. Subsequently, I conducted in-depth analysis using MATLAB to derive valuable insights from the acquired data.The Nasal Sensor Module is designed to provide real-time sensor readings interfaced via an Atmega328 microcontroller. The sensor data is then relayed to a mobile application created using Blynk. Additionally, the data is stored on an SD card for offline analysis. To understand the system better, refer to the provided system_diagram.
